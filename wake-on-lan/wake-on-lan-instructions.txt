SERVER SIDE INSTRUCTIONS-

sudo apt-get install ethtool -y

sudo ethtool -s INTERFACE wol g    (where INTERFACE is name of the network interface to be used for WOL. in my virtual machine it's eth0)

sudo apt-get install wakeonlan -y

but doing above this will not bind the enabling of that interface to WOL(Wake On LAN), and it won't survive a reboot. To solve this problem run this commands on the machine.

sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/wol.service

paste this thing in the opened file.

WantedBy=basic.target 



save and close file. Then run this command.


sudo systemctl daemon-reload

sudo systemctl enable wol.service

sudo systemctl start wol.service


After all this, in file mac-list.txt , enter the MAC address of the 10 machines and then run following commands

 gcc wakeonlan.c
 ./a.out




 On the REMOTE machines which are to be powered on-

 run this command-

 ethtool -s eth0 wol g   //instead of eth0, use the name of ethernet interface

 this will set the machine to listen for magic packets.
