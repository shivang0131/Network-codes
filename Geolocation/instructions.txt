python geolocation-plot.py


--remember to edit the location for storing the HTML file because the one in the code is corresponding to my system.
--you can zoom out to get a better view of the location since the line seems to be overflowing.
--in the latitude_list and longitude_list you can put any number of coordinates to plot lines between them.
--on the terminal (or Anaconda Prompt), it'll print several other data like city, ZIP code, service provider, etc. You can use them if you want.
